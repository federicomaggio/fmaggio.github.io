Hello, and welcome to the site! I'm currently a graduate student in economics at West Virginia University, with fields in public, urban/regional, and applied microeconomics broadly. Primarily, my research is focused on the interaction between individuals and different institutional settings, with a particular interest in legal systems. Before joing WVU's economics department, I spent a year in the Natural Resource Economics department working on research related to fishery production following completion of my Pell Grant funded undergraduate degree at Bloomsburg University. I love playing around with and incorporating new methods into my work. I also am a pretty big fan of spending time outdoors.
