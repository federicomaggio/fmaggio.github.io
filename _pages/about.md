Hello, and welcome to the site! I'm currently a graduate student in economics at West Virginia University, with fields in public, urban/regional, and applied microeconomics broadly. Primarily, my research is focused on the interaction between individuals and different institutional settings, with a particular interest in legal systems. Before joing WVU's economics department, I spent a year in the Natural Resource Economics department working on research related to fishery production following completion of my Pell Grant funded undergraduate degree at Bloomsburg University. 

## Job Market Paper: Better On Average?

My job market paper incorporates the term structure and introduces the Fed’s new average inflation targeting (AIT) framework into a DSGE model with an occasionally binding zero-lower bound. When agents know how the Fed conducts this averaging, AIT improves the stability of inflation and household utility compared to standard inflation targeting. Inflation is most stable, and household utility is highest, when the Fed targets average inflation over 8 and 16 quarters, respectively. However, the Fed has not revealed how many lags they plan to incorporate into their average, and this imperfect information affects the model’s results. If agents don’t know the details of the policy, inflation is most stable when the Fed averages inflation over longer periods. However, outcomes are always better when the Fed reveals the specific details about the policy. You can download my paper [here](/files/Better_On_Average_JMP.pdf).
