Hello, thanks for taking a look! I'm currently a graduate student in the Department of Economics at West Virginia University, with fields in public and urban/regional. I'm on the job market this year, hoping for an academic position. Primarily, my research is focused on the interaction between individuals under different institutional settings and constraints, with a particular interest in legal systems. Before joing WVU's Economics department, I spent a year in the Natural Resource Economics department here, working on research related to fishery production. My undergrad was completed through Pell Grant funding at Bloomsburg University in Central Pennsylvania. I love playing around with and incorporating new empirical methods into my work. More importantly, I also am a pretty big fan of spending time outdoors.
