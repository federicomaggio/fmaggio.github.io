In addition to economics, I've gotten to do a lot of other fun things. I grew up in Lubbock, TX, where my parents own and operate [Joyland Amusement Park](https://joylandpark.com/). I played golf competitvely during my high school and undergrad years, and still play recreationally (current handicap: 2.1). Additonally, while in undergrad, I spent a semester in Washington DC interning for the Cato Institute. In my free time, I like to play golf and basketball, watch sports (go Mavs! go Cowboys!), and just be a [fun guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIwh0njInPk&ab_channel=Ball).
