I was born in Hartford, CT but moved to the Philadlephia area when I was very young to be closer to my dad's family. Before college, I spent a few years traveling and working all sorts of jobs. I've been a cook at two different Italian restaraunts in Honolulu, a commercial fisherman, a union low-voltage electrician, and a legal assistant at a criminal defense firm, among other jobs. Most of my free time is spent going on adventures outdoors (primarily with my fiance and awesome best friend, an 11 year old Poi dog I adopted as a teenager), reading a pretty eclectic range of books, and hanging out with friends and family. I love old Sci-Fi and corny comedies (in the vein of Step Brothers). For a while, I tried pursuing a boxing career. It didn't work out too well, but I did get the opportunity to get beat up by a world champion. Most importantly, as a kid my dream was to be an astronaut. I think I'm clearly heading in the right direction to fulfill that one.
