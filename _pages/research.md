    <b>Abstract</b>
    
Ocean temperatures are increasing. Little work has been done to examine the effects that these changes will have on fishery production. The study at hand seeks to incorporate the influence of climate change into an established static bioeconomic fishery model. Stock biomass is approximated to be a function of sea surface temperature. Following a feasible generalized least squares regression using data from the Western and Central Pacific, the interaction between fishery effort and temperature is found to be statistically significant. From this model, various functional forms relating effort, catch, profit, and temperature are specified. In particular, a function that returns an effort requirement given a target catch level and temperature forecast is generated.The importance of these tools for fishery management is explored through application to Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries. Recommendations for extensions into future research are made and the foundation for a model of efficient effort allocation across time and the entirety of a management area, given changing temperatures, is specified. The study has succeeded in establishing the statistically significant role that temperature plays in the fishery production function.


## Working Papers
- "The Right to Counsel: Criminal Prosecution in 19th Century London"(with B. McCannon), under review.

    <b>Abstract</b>
    
Exploiting a novel data set of criminal trials in 19th century London, we evaluate the impact of an accusedâ€™s right to counsel on convictions. While lower-level crimes had an established history of allowing for professional representation prior to 1836, individuals accused of committing a felony did not eventhough the prosecution was conducted by attorneys. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy we identify the causal effect of defense counsel. We find the surprising result that the professionalization of the courtroom led to an increase in the conviction rate, which we interpret as a consequence of jurors feeling that the trial became fairer. We go further and employ a topic modeling approach to the text of the transcripts to provide suggestive evidence on how the trials changed when defense counsel was fully introduced.


- ["Gentrification, Gun Violence, and Coordination Failure"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3930763), under review

    <b>Abstract</b>
    
In this study, I demonstrate the causal linkage between gentrification and gun violence. I develop a theoretical model of competition in the unregulated illegal drug market, and draw the conclusion that violence in the market is, in part, caused by the officially unenforceable nature of territorial claims. Exogenous shocks, such as gentrification, keep viable territory in a state of constant flux, preventing sustained cooperation between these illegal actors. I then specify a two-way fixed effects differences-in-differences estimator to empirically test the model's prediction that the gentrification of one block will lead to increases in violence across the surrounding neighborhood. I find a robust result, that some 2,400 (8%) of Philadelphia's shootings over the decade of this study's window can be attributed to spillover effects from the gentrification of drug blocks. This effect is nearly ten times stronger when it is a high drug crime block that begins gentrifying. This study further contributes a new easily replicable empirical measurement of gentrification drawn primarily from property sales, along with building, zoning, and alteration permit issuance. This new measurement is able to capture gentrification at its finest and most realistic resolution: the individual block level.

- "Three Golden Balls: Pawn Shops and Crime" (with B. McCannon and Z. Rodriguez)

    <b>Abstract</b>

We ask what the relationship is between pawn shops and crime. The dominant narrative is that pawn shops reduce the transaction costs of crime and, consequently, promote it. We explore the alternative where pawn shops address the financial distress of those in need, which reduces the incentive to engage in crime. We exploit two distinct policies affecting access to pawn shops $-$ severe licensing fees implemented in London in the early 1800s and state variation in the classification of pawn shops as essential businesses during the Covid pandemic in spring 2020. For each, employing a difference-in-difference identification strategy we provide evidence that restrictions to pawn shop access
